# Learning JavaScript, CSS and HTML

## My First Project

## About Me:

Hi, I'm Ana Vallejo. I studied *Management in tourism and hospitality*, which has allowed me to understand the importance of creating memorable experiences for people.  

Recently, I decided to venture into the world of _programming_, motivated by the desire to expand my skills and explore new forms of innovation. Currently, I’m working on my first project, a _digital portfolio_ where I showcase what I have learned so far.  

This new path has challenged me, helped me discover creative solutions, and developed a new way of thinking. I'm excited for everything that’s ahead!  

## Technical meanings I'm Learning

| Technology | Description |

- HTML is the markup language used to structure the content of a webpage. Let me know if you need any refinements!
- It is a standard language used to provide structure and content to a webpage. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!

| What can HTML do|
|----------------------|
|- Create and organize elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.|
|-  Embed multimedia such as images, videos, and audio files.|
|- Build forms for user input, including login fields, search bars, and surveys.|
|- Link pages together using hyperlinks (a tags) for easy navigation.|
|- Define document structure using semantic elements (header, section, footer), which improves accessibility and SEO.|
|- Integrate CSS and JavaScript to style and add interactivity to web pages.|

- It is a programming language that allows web pages to respond to actions and be dynamic and interactive. Let me know if you need any adjustments!

| **What can JS do?** |
|-----------------------|
|- **Manipulate the DOM** – Modify elements, change styles, and update content dynamically.|
|- **Handle events** – Respond to user actions like clicks, scrolling, and key presses.|
|- **Validate forms** – Ensure user input follows the correct format before submission.|
|- **Create animations** – Add effects like fading, sliding, and transitions.|
|- **Communicate with servers** – Fetch data from APIs using AJAX or the Fetch API.|
|- **Develop web applications** – Power frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.|

 - It is used to style an HTML page by applying colors, sizes, margins, fonts, positioning, animations, and much more. 

 | **what can CCS do?** |
 |------------------------|
 |- Change the background and text color.
 |- Use different fonts.
 |- Organize the elements (align or center them)
 |- Create responsive designs for mobile phones or tablets.
 |- Make animations and transiti

 - Git is the ***tool***, and GitHub ***is the service that allows you to use Git online***, collaborate with others, and share code with everyone.

  **Pseudo-classes** | **Pseudo-elements** |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| A pseudo-class targets an element based on its state or position in the document. It’s like saying, “style this element when something happens.” | A pseudo-element lets you style specific parts of an element or insert content that doesn’t exist in the HTML. |
| Example: a:hover styles a link when the user hovers over it. | Example: :: before adds content before an element, like a decorative icon. |
| Used to change the style of an element based on user interaction or structure. | Used to style a specific part of an element or to insert content. |
| Defined with a single colon : before the class name. | Defined with a double colon :: before the element name. |

 
**Most commun pseudo-element used:**

- Pseudo-classes are used in CSS to define a special state of an element, usually based on user interaction or its position in the DOM. For example, :hover applies styles when the user places the mouse over an element, and :active applies styles at the exact moment an element is being clicked. The **:focus** pseudo-class targets elements, like input fields, when they are focused (for instance, when a user clicks or tabs into them). Structural pseudo-classes like **:first-child** and **:last-child** are used to style the first or last child element within a parent container. Similarly, **:nth-child(n)** allows you to style elements based on their order, like the second or third child. The **:not()** pseudo-class is very useful when you want to select all elements except those that match a certain selector. Lastly, **:checked** is commonly used with form elements like checkboxes or radio buttons to style them once they are selected or activated.

- Pseudo-elements, on the other hand, allow you to style specific parts of an element's content that you normally couldn’t target with regular CSS selectors. The **::before** and **::after** pseudo-elements let you insert content before or after the actual content of an element without modifying the HTML. **::first-line** is used to style only the first line of a block of text (useful for headlines or creative paragraphs), while **::first-letter** styles just the first letter, which is often used in drop-cap designs. The **::placeholder** pseudo-element styles the placeholder text inside form fields. With **::selection**, you can customize how text looks when it’s highlighted by the user. **::marker** is used to style the bullets or numbers in lists, and **::backdrop** allows you to customize the background that appears behind modal elements, such as those shown by the dialog HTML element.


**flexbox & Grid**

_When to use Flexbox:_
- When you want to align elements in a single direction (a row or a column).

- When you’re working with a single line of content (for example, horizontally aligned buttons).

- When you want to distribute space between elements or center them easily.

_When to use Grid_
- When you need to create structures in rows and columns (like a table or a page layout).

- When you want more control over the overall design.

- When your layout looks like a grid.

         Real life examples for when to use Grid

_Diference between them:_
 - The most important thing to know as you're figuring out CSS Grid layouts vs. Flexbox, is that Flexbox is **one-dimensional**, while CSS Grid is **two-dimensional**.

 | Flexbox | Grid |
 |---------|----------|
 |Flexbox treats each row or column as a separate entity, based on its content and the available space | Grid lets you work along two axes: horizontally and vertically. Grid allows you to create two-dimensional layouts where you can precisely place grid items into cells defined by rows and columns.|
 | In flexbox, most of the layout (beyond the very basics) happen on the children. | Grid is mostly defined on the parent element.|
 |Flexbox can push things away. It’s a rather unique feature of flexbox that you can, for example, put margin-right: auto; on an element and, if there is room, that element will push everything else as far away as it can go can. | Grid is better at overlapping. Getting elements to overlap in flexbox requires looking at traditional stuff, like negative margins, transforms, or absolute positioning in order to break out of the flex behavior. With grid, we can place items on overlapping grid lines, or even right within the same exact grid cells.|
