# Learning JavaScript, CSS and HTML

## My First Project

## About Me:

Hi, I'm Ana Vallejo. I studied *Management in tourism and hospitality*, which has allowed me to understand the importance of creating memorable experiences for people.  

Recently, I decided to venture into the world of _programming_, motivated by the desire to expand my skills and explore new forms of innovation. Currently, I’m working on my first project, a _digital portfolio_ where I showcase what I have learned so far.  

This new path has challenged me, helped me discover creative solutions, and developed a new way of thinking. I'm excited for everything that’s ahead!  

## Technical meanings I'm Learning

| Technology | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **HTML**   | Structure and semantics of webpages 
| **CSS**    | Styling, animations, and responsive design 
| **JavaScript** | Dynamic interactions and functionality 
| **Git & GitHub** | Version control and collaborative coding 
| **Pseudo-elements & Pseudo-classes** | Advanced CSS selectors for styling 
| **Flexbox & Grid** | Layout techniques for responsive design 

## What I've learn so far:

- HTML is the markup language used to structure the content of a webpage. Let me know if you need any refinements!
- It is a standard language used to provide structure and content to a webpage. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!

| What can HTML do|
|----------------------|
|- Create and organize elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.|
|-  Embed multimedia such as images, videos, and audio files.|
|- Build forms for user input, including login fields, search bars, and surveys.|
|- Link pages together using hyperlinks (a tags) for easy navigation.|
|- Define document structure using semantic elements (header, section, footer), which improves accessibility and SEO.|
|- Integrate CSS and JavaScript to style and add interactivity to web pages.|

- It is a programming language that allows web pages to respond to actions and be dynamic and interactive. Let me know if you need any adjustments!

| **What can JS do?** |
|-----------------------|
|- **Manipulate the DOM** – Modify elements, change styles, and update content dynamically.|
|- **Handle events** – Respond to user actions like clicks, scrolling, and key presses.|
|- **Validate forms** – Ensure user input follows the correct format before submission.|
|- **Create animations** – Add effects like fading, sliding, and transitions.|
|- **Communicate with servers** – Fetch data from APIs using AJAX or the Fetch API.|
|- **Develop web applications** – Power frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.|

 - It is used to style an HTML page by applying colors, sizes, margins, fonts, positioning, animations, and much more. 

 | **what can CCS do?** |
 |------------------------|
 |- Change the background and text color.
 |- Use different fonts.
 |- Organize the elements (align or center them)
 |- Create responsive designs for mobile phones or tablets.
 |- Make animations and transiti

 - Git is the ***tool***, and GitHub ***is the service that allows you to use Git online***, collaborate with others, and share code with everyone.

  **Pseudo-classes** | **Pseudo-elements** |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| A pseudo-class targets an element based on its state or position in the document. It’s like saying, “style this element when something happens.” | A pseudo-element lets you style specific parts of an element or insert content that doesn’t exist in the HTML. |
| Example: a:hover styles a link when the user hovers over it. | Example: :: before adds content before an element, like a decorative icon. |
| Used to change the style of an element based on user interaction or structure. | Used to style a specific part of an element or to insert content. |
| Defined with a single colon : before the class name. | Defined with a double colon :: before the element name. |

 
**Most commun pseudo-element used:**

- Pseudo-classes are used in CSS to define a special state of an element, usually based on user interaction or its position in the DOM. For example, :hover applies styles when the user places the mouse over an element, and :active applies styles at the exact moment an element is being clicked. The **:focus** pseudo-class targets elements, like input fields, when they are focused (for instance, when a user clicks or tabs into them). Structural pseudo-classes like **:first-child** and **:last-child** are used to style the first or last child element within a parent container. Similarly, **:nth-child(n)** allows you to style elements based on their order, like the second or third child. The **:not()** pseudo-class is very useful when you want to select all elements except those that match a certain selector. Lastly, **:checked** is commonly used with form elements like checkboxes or radio buttons to style them once they are selected or activated.

- Pseudo-elements, on the other hand, allow you to style specific parts of an element's content that you normally couldn’t target with regular CSS selectors. The **::before** and **::after** pseudo-elements let you insert content before or after the actual content of an element without modifying the HTML. **::first-line** is used to style only the first line of a block of text (useful for headlines or creative paragraphs), while **::first-letter** styles just the first letter, which is often used in drop-cap designs. The **::placeholder** pseudo-element styles the placeholder text inside form fields. With **::selection**, you can customize how text looks when it’s highlighted by the user. **::marker** is used to style the bullets or numbers in lists, and **::backdrop** allows you to customize the background that appears behind modal elements, such as those shown by the dialog HTML element.


**flexbox & Grid**
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*5WxLCnuAebfk11AyktuOew.png"> 

_When to use Flexbox:_
- When you want to align elements in a single direction (a row or a column).

- When you’re working with a single line of content (for example, horizontally aligned buttons).

- When you want to distribute space between elements or center them easily.

_When to use Grid_
- When you need to create structures in rows and columns (like a table or a page layout).

- When you want more control over the overall design.

- When your layout looks like a grid (grid = lattice).
